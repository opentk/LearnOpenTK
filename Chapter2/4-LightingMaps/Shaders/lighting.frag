// Now the diffuse and the specular values are controlled by textures, this is what we in graphics call mapping something.
// This means they are now based on textures instead of a color, and can be controlled much better per fragment.
// This also allows us the ability to texture our objects again.

// Note: We dont have a value for the ambient, as that is mostly the same the diffuse in pretty much every single situation.

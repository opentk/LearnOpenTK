            // This effectively sends all the vertices at the same time.

            //   How much data is being sent, in bytes. You can generally set this to the length of your array, multiplied by sizeof(array type).
            //   The vertices themselves.
            //   How the buffer will be used, so that OpenGL can write the data to the proper memory space on the GPU.

            //     StaticDraw: This buffer will rarely, if ever, update after being initially uploaded.

            //     StreamDraw: This buffer will change on every frame.
            //   Writing to the proper memory space is important! Generally, you'll only want StaticDraw,
            //   but be sure to use the right one for your use case.
            GL.BufferData(BufferTarget.ArrayBuffer, _vertices.Length * sizeof(float), _vertices, BufferUsageHint.StaticDraw);

            // One notable thing about the buffer we just loaded data into is that it doesn't have any structure to it. It's just a bunch of floats (which are actaully just bytes).
            // The opengl driver doesn't know how this data should be interpreted or how it should be divided up into vertices. To do this opengl introduces the idea of a 
            // Vertex Array Obejct (VAO) which has the job of keeping track of what parts or what buffers correspond to what data. In this example we want to set our VAO up so that 
            // it tells opengl that we want to interpret 12 bytes as 3 floats and divide the buffer into vertices using that.
            // To do this we generate and bind a VAO (which looks deceptivly similar to creating and binding a VBO, but they are different!).

            // While this makes them incredibly flexible, it means we have to specify how that data will be mapped to the shader's input variables.

            // To do this, we use the GL.VertexAttribPointer function
            // This function has two jobs, to tell opengl about the format of the data, but also to associate the current array buffer with the VAO.
            // This means that after this call, we have setup this attribute to source data from the current array buffer and interpret it in the way we specified.
            // Arguments:
            //   Location of the input variable in the shader. the layout(location = 0) line in the vertex shader explicitly sets it to 0.
            //   How many elements will be sent to the variable. In this case, 3 floats for every vertex.
            //   The data type of the elements set, in this case float.
            //   Whether or not the data should be converted to normalized device coordinates. In this case, false, because that's already done.
            //   The stride; this is how many bytes are between the last element of one vertex and the first element of the next. 3 * sizeof(float) in this case.
            //   The offset; this is how many bytes it should skip to find the first element of the first vertex. 0 as of right now.
            // Stride and Offset are just sort of glossed over for now, but when we get into texture coordinates they'll be shown in better detail.

            // The drawback is that we actually need two more programs for this! These are called "shaders".
            // Shaders are tiny programs that live on the GPU. OpenGL uses them to handle the vertex-to-pixel pipeline.

                //   Level of detail. We can use this to start from a smaller mipmap (if we want), but we don't need to do that, so leave it at 0.

            // You could also use (amongst other options) Nearest, which just grabs the nearest pixel, which makes the texture look pixelated if scaled too far.
            // NOTE: The default settings for both of these are LinearMipmap. If you leave these as default but don't generate mipmaps,

            // Next, generate mipmaps.

            // Generated mipmaps go all the way down to just one pixel.
            // OpenGL will automatically switch between mipmaps when an object gets sufficiently far away.

            // You could also use (amongst other options) Nearest, which just grabs the nearest pixel, which makes the texture look pixelated if scaled too far.
            // NOTE: The default settings for both of these are LinearMipmap. If you leave these as default but don't generate mipmaps,

            // OpenGL will automatically switch between mipmaps when an object gets sufficiently far away.
